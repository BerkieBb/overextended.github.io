# QBCore

<Callout type="warning">
  QBCore is unsupported. You must use Qbox if you want to use QB based resources with ox_inventory
</Callout>

## Qbox Project

Qbox is a fork of QBCore being developed by a team of former contributors and developers on QBCore. The team is focused on improving performance and security, as well as converting resources to support our resources (mainly ox_lib and ox_inventory).

We _strongly_ advise using Qbox as an alternative to QBCore.
