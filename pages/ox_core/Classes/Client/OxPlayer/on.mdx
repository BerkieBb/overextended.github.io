# OxPlayer.on

<Callout>
  Documentation is work in progress as ox_core is still in development.<br />
  This is written for `ox_core v0.31.1`
</Callout>

Creates a listener for when a value of a specific key changes (e.g. is set as replicated by [set()](../../Server/OxPlayer/set)).

```lua
player.on(key, cb(data))
```

- key: `string`
- cb: `function`
  - this will be called when the value of `key` changes
- data: `unknown`
  - new value of `key`
